# Node Boilerplate

## Usecases

Server must have functional login system with profile page (optional: upload custom user avatar)

Server must have app focused layout, with home icon, searchbar, auth icon, filters, content, hotbar, and footer.

## Accreditation

The 'apps' shown in the hotbar come from third party sites. Both the images and client side source code when entering those urls are from devextreme.
